Quarkly is a tool for creating websites, landing pages, and web applications. It combines a visual editor, an integrated development environment, and a website builder. It allows developers to add business logic as well as code their own components, which are then available in the visual editor.

#### How Quarkly works

All Quarkly projects are based on **React components** and the **@quarkly/atomize** library. Every single primitive on the editor's layout is ready-to-use and reusable code.

#### When developing a component, you can

- Add descriptions for component properties;
- Display component properties on the right panel of the visual editor in the form of controls;
- Use overrides for:
  - naming subcomponents;
  - selecting and editing subcomponents in the visual editor;
  - adding different states.
- Define effects (pseudo classes) for different states;
- Apply style variables from the project theme;
- Import other components from NPM or an embedded catalog.
