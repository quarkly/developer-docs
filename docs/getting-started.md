1. After logging in, you will be taken to the [Dashboard](/interface/dashboard/overview). Two projects are automatically created for you:

    - **Onboarding Tutorial** that will teach you the basics of Quarkly
    - **Website Example** — a ready-made website example

    ![Dashboard](/scr/getting-started-dashboard-default.png)

2. Create a new Quarkly project. To do this, click on the card with the "**+**" icon and enter the project name. ![Creating a new Quarkly project](/scr/getting-started-dashboard-creating.png)

3. Now go to the project. To do that, click it or call the context menu and select "**Open**". ![Project context menu on the dashboard](/scr/getting-started-dashboard-opening.png)

4. You are now in the [visual editor interface](/interface/overview). To allow other users to access, rename, or delete the project, open its settings. ![Menu of project settings in the visual editor](/scr/getting-started-interface-project-actions.png)

5. Add a finished block to the layout by clicking the "**+**" icon in the center of the page. ![Adding a ready-made block to the page](/scr/getting-started-interface-add-block.png)

6. Select the block you like and click on it. ![Selecting a ready-made block from the catalog](/scr/getting-started-interface-choose-block.png)

7. Now select the text element on the page. Click it while pressing `Ctrl`, or `⌘ (Cmd)` on MacOS. This allows you to select elements while ignoring parent ones. You can also select child elements by double-clicking them. ![Selecting components on the page](/scr/getting-started-interface-select-element.png)

8. Change the text color on the right property panel. ![Changing the text color on the props panel](/scr/getting-started-interface-edit-font-color.png)

9. Edit text. To do that, double-click the text in the selected element. ![Text editing](/scr/getting-started-interface-edit-text.png)

10. You can create pages. To do that, open the [Pages and Layers](/interface/left-panels/pages-and-layers/overview) panel. !["Pages and Layers" panel](/scr/getting-started-interface-pages-and-layers.png)

11. To add an element, go to the [Components](/interface/components/overview) panel. There are both simple and complex components. You can also create custom components. !["Components" panel](/scr/getting-started-interface-components.png)

12. Just drag the component to the desired place and it will become part of the page. ![Dragging and dropping a component onto the page](/scr/getting-started-interface-add-new-element.png)

13. Publish the project. To start [publishing](/interface/top-bar/publication/overview), click "**Publish**". ![Project publication](/scr/getting-started-interface-publish-button.png)

14. Connect your GitHub account to export your project to the repository. ![Connecting a GitHub account](/scr/getting-started-interface-publication-window.png)

15. Select "New repository", enter the name, and click "Create repository". ![Creating a new repository](/scr/getting-started-interface-destination-new-repository.png)

16. After connecting the repository, connect your Netlify account. ![Connecting a Netlify account](/scr/getting-started-interface-publication-netlify.png)

17. Select "New website" and click "Create website". ![Creating a new website](/scr/getting-started-interface-publication-netlify-new-site.png)

18. The process of project building takes a few minutes. Once the badge changes status to "**Success**", the project is published and available via a link. ![Project building status](/scr/getting-started-interface-publication-netlify-status.png)

19. Click the link to open the published project. ![Link to the published project](/scr/getting-started-interface-publication-netlify-link.png)

Congrats! You've just created and published your first project on Quarkly.
