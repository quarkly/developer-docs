title: How to Create Components Using Atomize
sidebar_label: Overview
---

Atomize makes it easier to create a component and lets you integrate your component into Quarkly. Atomize allows you to:

- Style your component with properties using atomic CSS;
- Display the component properties on the builder;
- Add various effects (hover, etc.) to a component;
- Add different styles for breakpoints;
- Use variables from the project theme.

This is necessary, first of all to create your own primitives (which are not in the Quarkly library) for later use in the main components.
