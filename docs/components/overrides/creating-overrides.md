The list of all overrides used in the component is described in the object called `overrides`. The object properties correspond to custom override names and can contain the `kind` and `props` fields. You decide which components and states can be changed.

For example, let's add an override called "**My Link**" for a **Link** component and give it the `src` property:

```js
const overrides = {
  "My Link": {
    kind: "Link",
    props: {
      src: "#",
    },
  },
};
```

The `kind` property allows you to use a set of properties from another component. To do this, you must specify the system name of a standard or custom existing component. Then the properties of this component will be available on the Props panel in the builder. In the example above, we created a custom component with a link and now we want to add properties to it from the **Link** component. The `kind: 'Link'` property is added automatically.

In the `props` object, you can specify a list of CSS styles and any props you'd like to transfer to the component with this override name.

To describe a property, just set the property name and value, as in the `src` example.

And the CSS styles can be described in different ways:

- standard description<br/>`color: '#212121'`
- aliases from the Atomize library<br/>`c: '#212121'`
- variables from the project theme<br/>`color: '--color-dark'`<br/>`color: '--dark'`
- breakpoints from the project theme<br/>`'md-color': '#212121'`
- state effects<br/>`'link-color': '--primary'`<br/>`'focus-color': '--secondary'`<br/>`'hover-color': '--orange'`<br/>`'active-color': '--red'`<br/>`'visited-color': '--indigo'`

So the object with the description of overrides might look like this:

```js
const overrides = {
  "My Link": {
    kind: "Link",
    props: {
      color: "--primary",
      "hover-color": "--secondary",
      font: "--base",
      "md-font": "--lead",
      src: "#",
    },
  },
};
```
