Different states are available for some components, here are a few of them:

-   hover — a state triggered when hovering over an element
-   focus — state when an element gets focus
-   active, for a &lt;Button/&gt; and an &lt;Input/&gt; — state when an element is active
-   disabled, for a &lt;Button/&gt; — state when a button is disabled
-   link, for a &lt;Link/&gt; — state for an unvisited link
-   visited, for a &lt;Link/&gt; — state for a visited link
-   and more

You can also specify properties and values for such states in your code using the following syntax: state-props="value". For example:

```
<Text hover-color="orange"> Orange text </Text>
```
