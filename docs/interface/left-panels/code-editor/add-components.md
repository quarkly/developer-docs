To add a component, enter its name as an HTML tag, for example:

```
<Text> Simple text </Text>
```

### Primitive

You can add any primitive:

-   &lt;Box/&gt;
-   &lt;Button/&gt;
-   &lt;Hr/&gt;
-   &lt;Image/&gt;
-   &lt;Input/&gt;
-   &lt;Link/&gt;
-   &lt;List/&gt;
-   &lt;Text/&gt;

### Custom component

A custom component is a component you created or added by specifying its name. For example, to add your component called MyComponent to a page you need to write:

```
<MyComponent/>
```

### Nested component

If you want to nest one component inside another, you need to write:

```
<MyComponent>
  <Text>Simple text</Text>
</MyComponent>
```
