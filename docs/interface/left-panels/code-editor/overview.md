The second most important work area in Quarkly is the code editor. It displays all the components and their props that you can see on the screen. You can also work with the components, their props, and values much faster than on the page. You need to be able to follow JSX syntax, and know the set of available components, CSS props, and values.

### Code editor commands

There are many useful actions in the code editor, such as duplicate line down, increase font size, find, and replace. Press `F1` to see all the available actions.

### Code save status

![Code state status](/scr/code-editor-status.png)

In the upper right corner of the code editor window, you can find the save status. If you didn't save the changes, they won't show up on the page. To apply changes to the code, press the key combination `Ctrl` + `S` or `âŒ˜(Cmd)` + `S` for MacOS.
