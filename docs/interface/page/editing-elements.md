<YouTube videoId="NFfHupUQnHY" />

You can use your mouse to resize elements with absolute and fixed position. Just grab any corner or edge of the selected element and pull it to the desired size.

### Text editing

When you select the text, a bar allowing you to quickly edit the text appears above the selected text. There, you can find the following action buttons:

-   Bold
-   Italic
-   Insert link
-   Convert to a part (span)
-   Clear formatting

### Converting to span

If you need to restyle part of the text, for example, highlight a few words, highlight a sentence, or change the letter spacing of a word, you can select the desired part of the text and convert it to span by clicking on the ![Wrap to span icon](/img/icon-interface-span.svg) icon. After the conversion, you can change the style of the span if needed â€” apply any properties from the panel.
