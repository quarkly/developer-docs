![Select an element on a page](/scr/selection-element.png)

To select an element at the highest or current nesting level, just click it. If you need to select a nested element one level down from the current one, there are two ways:

-   Use double-click to go down one level of nesting
-   Click on an element while holding `Ctrl` or `⌘(Cmd)` for MacOS. In this case, the hierarchy of elements isn't taken into account.

To reset the selection, press `Esc`.

### Group selection of elements

There are two ways to select several elements:

-   Click and hold `Shift` on the desired elements at the same level
-   While holding `Shift` and `Ctrl` or `⇧(Shift)` and `⌘(Cmd)` for MacOS, click on the desired elements at any level.

To deselect, click the element again with the keys held.

### Spacing display

To see the spacing between elements, select the first element, press `Alt` or `⌥(Option)` for MacOS and point at the second element. If you want to see the spacing to the nested element, hold `Ctrl` and `Alt` or `⌘(Cmd)` and `⌥(Option)` for MacOS.
