Breakpoints (control points) are conditions under which additional design options appear on your page. Breakpoint values contain the following set of properties:

-   Type, breakpoint type with max-width before the specified value and min-width after the specified value.
-   Value, breakpoint values in pixels.

The breakpoints specified in the theme are applied to all pages. To add a breakpoint to the theme, click on the "**+**" icon in front of the category.
