React projects contain dependencies, work files, and content. You need a certain structure to organize the assembly of projects.

The export structure is the way the files in the project are organized, how the project will be built, and which auxiliary libraries will be involved in project building. In Quarkly, we offer two of the most popular structures:

-   Gatsby Project — more suits websites
-   Create React App — more suits applications
