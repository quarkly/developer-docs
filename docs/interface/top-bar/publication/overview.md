![Project Publishing Window](/scr/publication-general.png)

For a project to be available at a URL, it must be created and published. The "**Publish**" button opens a modal window for publishing the project. The project is built in your GitHub repository and published using the Netlify service.

So, to publish the project:

1. Choose the project structure.
2. Log in or sign up to GitHub.
3. Attach the project to a new or existing repository.
4. Save the code to the repository if you have selected an existing repository.
5. Log in or sign up to Netlify.
6. Attach the project to a new or existing site.
7. Click "**Deploy**".

Project creation and publishing usually takes a few minutes. The status can be seen on the badge ![badge-building](/img/netlify-badge-building.svg)
