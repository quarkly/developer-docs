After you save the project in the GitHub repository, you can publish it using [Netlify](https://netlify.app/).

To choose a site and start publication:

1. Click "**Log In with Netlify**" to give Quarkly access to your sites on Netlify. Log in or sign up to Netlify, if necessary.
2. Select an existing site in your Netlify account or create a new one.
3. Click "**Build**" to start building and then publishing the project.

Project creation and publishing usually takes a few minutes.

The status can be seen on the badge:
