Top bar is a bar at the top of the builder. It allows you to open the layers and pages panel, the code editor, publish the project, open the page preview, undo or redo changes and perform other actions. The panel contains:

-   **Dashboard**<br /> Here you create, delete, and go to projects.

-   **Pages and Layers**<br /> Here you manage pages and page layers (elements).

-   **Code Editor**<br /> Here you edit the code of the page and components.

-   **Project Name**<br /> With a double click, you can change the project name.

-   **Actions on the Project**<br /> Here you rename the project, open its properties, share the project with others, or delete it. To do this, click the ![Arrow Down](/img/icon-arrow-down. svg) icon and a list of actions will appear:

    -   [Share](/interface/top-bar/share)
    -   [Settings](/interface/right-panels/project-settings/overview)
    -   Rename
    -   Delete

-   **Undo**<br /> Undo any action in the project.

-   **Redo**<br /> Redo a canceled action in the project.

-   **Preview**<br /> Go to page preview mode. This is useful when you want to see how different effects work, for example, when hovering over an element.

-   **Publish**<br /> The project must be published to be accessible from a URL. The "**Publish**" button opens a modal window for publishing the project.<br /> [Learn more](/interface/top-bar/publication/overview)
