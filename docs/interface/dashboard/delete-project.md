![The "Delete forever" option in the context menu deletes the project forever](/scr/dashboard-delete-project.png)

To delete your project forever:

1.  Go to the "**Archived**" section
2.  Select the project you want to remove forever
3.  Right-click to call the project context menu
4.  Select "**Delete Forever**"
5.  In the confirmation dialog window, click "**Delete Forever**"

After the project is deleted forever, it disappears from the Dashboard. But if you still need to restore this project, send a request to the Quarkly support team.
