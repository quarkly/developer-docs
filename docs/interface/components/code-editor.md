![Creating a Component in the Code Editor](/scr/components-creating-plus.png)

To create a code component, click on the "**+**" button. You should be familiar with JavaScript and React.js. Once you’ve chosen the component name, the code editor will open, and you’ll see a default component. Code components allow:

-   Setting up any kind of content.
-   Styling content however you like.
-   Configuring any logic.
-   Connecting NPM dependencies.
-   Connecting primitives and Quarkly UI components.
-   Defining props (properties) for a component.
-   Connecting to any external databases or API.
