Zoom in on the page if you want to take a closer look at the details, and zoom out if you want to see an overall view of the page design. To speed up your work even more, use the following shortcuts:

| Action      | Windows and Linux | MacOS           |
| :---------- | :---------------- | :-------------- |
| Zoom in     | `Ctrl` + `+`      | `⌘ (Cmd)` + `+` |
| Zoom out    | `Ctrl` + `-`      | `⌘ (Cmd)` + `-` |
| Actual size | `Ctrl` + `0`      | `⌘ (Cmd)` + `0` |
