Breakpoints (control points) are the conditions under which additional design options for your page appear. For example, if your screen width is less than 768px, your can turn your four-column layout into a two-column layout.

Choosing the breakpoint design is up to you. Just activate the desired breakpoint and set the element styles. There are three ways to activate a breakpoint:

-   Select an option from the dropdown list.
-   Click on the corresponding breakpoint width range on the panel.
-   Stretch or narrow down the page to the desired width.

If you want to add a custom breakpoint or edit an existing one, go to the Theme panel and click on the `+` button to add a new value to the Breakpoints section.
